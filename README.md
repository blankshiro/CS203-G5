## Description

Ryverbank API is an online banking application that allows users to manage their accounts, view
curated content on banking and finance, and trade stocks in real time. Users are able to send and 
receive data via HTTP requests in JSON format.

### Running the REST API locally

Navigate to (`RyverbankApplication.java`) and execute `mvnw spring-boot:run`.

If the program compiles with no errors, the servlet should be running at [localhost:8080]
